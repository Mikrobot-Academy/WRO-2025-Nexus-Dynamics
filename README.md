Our mission:
============
To design and build a fully autonomous vehicle capable of navigating a dynamic arena, completing three full laps in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions, detecting walls, handling corners with a custom PID control system, and parking with precision in any of the six designated zones.
Our robot is powered by a Raspberry Pi 5 Model B, equipped with:
A DC motor for propulsion,

1. A servo motor for steering,

2. Three ultrasonic sensors for spatial awareness,

3. camera support for vision-based development.


This repo contains all our code, schematics, planning documentation, and media that showcase our journey from concept to competition.

We are Team NEXUS DYNAMICS future-focused, logic-driven, and proudly engineered for the WRO world stage.
